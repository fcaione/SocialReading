## ***Description***
### In an attempt to innovate book review websites and further connect the users, this project lets readers connect, track their reading progress, and annotate/post/analyze based on their progress in the book. These posts will be available to other users depending on their own progress so users can have conversations with people at similar progress points, emulating a digital book club. For those who need to decompress after that stressful chapter.
